## Benchmark Graph Generator for Vital Node Recognition
BG<sup>2</sup>VN is a MATLAB toolbox designed for generating benchmark graphs that are composed of ground-truth vital nodes.
It provides a standardized evaluation benchmark for vital node mining algorithms and allows for adjustments to the graph's heterogeneity and aggregation
based on user requirements.
